It’s been exactly one week since the most impressive show I’ve seen, and here are the key takeaways I want you to remember.

## 🤯 No hype, no party

When I asked people why they went to La Velada 5, everyone had a different reason: some for a specific artist, others for the mix—and many because **they didn’t know what would happen**.

Ibai managed that curiosity from the very first date announcement (March). So much so that **95% of tickets sold out by May**, and the artists **weren’t even announced** until early July. Takeaway: **well-dosed mystery sells**.

## 🛍️ Brands still haven’t cracked activations that people love

Several brand activations fell flat or confused the crowd:

- Revolut, the main sponsor, staged an in-stadium choreography few understood.
- Coca-Cola printed ~80,000 A3 sheets for an opening activation… also unclear.
- Ceravet triggered collective cringe with its “CeraVestia” 🙅🏻‍♂️
- Spotify limited itself to encouraging likes on the event’s official playlist.

Suggestion: **copy what works**. The NBA, NFL, and MLB keep fans engaged with constant in-between-moments dynamics. **Interaction + pacing + clarity = winning activation**.

## 💼 Revenue diversification and business verticalization

Main revenue streams (estimates):

- **Tickets:** €37–€190 by zone → **> €5M** estimated.
- **Streaming:** subs, ads, and donations → **~ €1M**.
- **Sponsorships:** **~ €3M**.

On top of that, Ibai registered **La Velada del Año** under **Velaris-Kena Productions**, doubling down on **merch** and **IP**. This level of control lets him **optimize every euro** from production to rights and merchandising. Takeaway: **integrate vertically when you can and multiply your revenue lanes**.

## 🤑 Customers can tell when you’re overreaching

Am I really going to complain about paying **€130** for **8 hours** in Spain’s best stadium? We’re used to 2-hour concerts for ~€100 with a single screen behind the stage. **This show had 16 giant screens**.

The **pricing felt fair** for the value delivered. Ibai has been clear he wants to make the event profitable, **not cash-grab it**. Takeaway: **fair perceived value = zero friction**.

## 📱 The triumph of vertical video

Yes, **TikTok, you’ve won**.

The communication strategy was built on **vertical video**: TikToks, Reels, and YouTube Shorts—**all** from Ibai Llanos’ account.

- **2024:** 55 TikToks (build-up + event).
- **2025:** 126 TikToks (build-up + event + post).

Is that one reason the **Twitch concurrent peak** jumped from **5.9M (2024)** to **9.3M (2025)**? Takeaway: **think vertical, publish a lot, and orchestrate from one hub**.

There’s a lot to analyze and learn from this massive event—and even more to appreciate that we got to witness it, in person or from home.

**Respect!**
