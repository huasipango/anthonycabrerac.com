# About

I’m **Anthony Cabrera Córdova**, a Cloud/DevOps engineer from Santo Domingo, Ecuador. I help teams design, ship, and operate reliable products on AWS—then write down what worked so others can reuse it. I care about clear automation, cost awareness, and incident hygiene.

## What I do

- **Cloud & Ops.** AWS administration (EC2, RDS, S3, Beanstalk, CloudWatch, VPC, CloudFront, KMS), CI/CD with GitLab and Jenkins, IaC with Terraform, containers with Docker/Kubernetes.
- **Engineering.** Back-end/API work (Node.js, Java, PHP, .NET) and front-end (HTML/JS/CSS, React/Angular) when the project needs full-stack pragmatism.

## Where I’ve worked

I’ve built and maintained infrastructure remotely for organizations in Ecuador, Mexico, and the U.S.—including **Minu** (🇲🇽), **Plek** (🇲🇽), **National Home Rentals** (🇺🇸), **Alluriam Healthcare** (🇺🇸), and **ESPE University** (🇪🇨).

## Community & leadership

Beyond code, I’m active in **JCI** (Junior Chamber International). I served as **Executive Vice President of JCI Ecuador (2024)** and **Director of Information Technology (2025)**, and I’m a certified **National Trainer**. I was also part of the team recognized as **World Debate Champions** at the JCI World Congress in Taiwan a highlight of my journey as a facilitator and speaker.

I’m an **One Young World Ambassador** and often run workshops for local organizations—anything that helps people grow their voice and ship better work.

## Now

Day-to-day, I’m focused on:

- Streamlining CI/CD and delivery workflows.
- Observability that developers actually use.
- Practical cloud costs (right-sizing, storage policies, data egress habits).

If you’re building something ambitious and need reliable infra—or a hands-on partner to get you unstuck—I’d love to help.

### About this site

This site runs on **Astro** with the **Nordlys** theme and TailwindCSS, with a few custom components and a red “Icecream” color scheme I’m experimenting with. (See the blog for notes on configuration and theming.)
